      "For this project, I built a custom MAME arcade cabinet using waste MDF and salvaged timber from my joinery work, giving new life to materials that would have otherwise been discarded. The cabinet was designed from scratch and cut using basic woodworking tools, with a focus on keeping costs low while still achieving an authentic retro look and feel.",
      "I integrated an i-PAC circuit board to handle keyboard inputs from real arcade buttons and joysticks, giving the experience a true arcade feel. The cabinet also includes LED backlighting and a front-mounted coin button for added immersion.",
      "It runs Windows with HyperSpin as the front-end interface, supporting a library of over 4,000 classic games from various consoles and arcade systems. The build was a great way to combine my interest in retro gaming with hands-on woodworking and hardware integration skills."

  "greenhouseBoxes": {
    "paragraphs": [
      "For this project, I designed a series of planter box layouts within a greenhouse environment using SketchUp 3D software, combining visual planning with practical considerations for indoor cultivation. The model allowed me to explore different configurations for maximizing growing space while ensuring ease of access and efficient use of the greenhouse footprint.",
      "The construction process involved selecting materials suitable for the humid and controlled conditions of a greenhouse, with attention to drainage, airflow, and maintenance. Sustainability remained a key focus, incorporating reclaimed wood and moisture-resistant components to balance durability with environmental responsibility.",
      "This project highlights how digital tools like SketchUp can assist in conceptualizing and refining interior growing systems before implementation. The resulting layout supports high-density planting and optimized space usage, making it ideal for year-round cultivation in a compact, controlled environment."

        "Throughout my study, repetition and practice played a crucial role in helping me retain and apply new information. This project enabled me to create targeted quizzes tailored to my learning needs and pace. It gave me the flexibility to reinforce key concepts through custom questions and revisit topics as often as needed.",
        "While the current version is built around CyberOps content, the design is adaptable users can easily modify or replace the spreadsheet to suit any subject area. Whether it's IT, science, languages, or general knowledge, the tool can be repurposed to match.",
        "Beyond its practical use, this project served as a valuable way to apply and test the tools and skills I was learning throughout my coursework. It involved working with Python for data handling and conversion, Excel integration with pandas, web technologies like HTML, JavaScript, and JSON for the quiz interface, and user-focused design to ensure the experience was intuitive and engaging."

   "thematic": {
    "paragraphs": [
        "This project was created to streamline the process of thematic analysis by combining structured Excel sheets with automated data handling and web export tools. It simplifies what can often be a time-consuming and repetitive task, providing a more efficient way to organise and interpret qualitative data.",
        "I designed this system to reduce manual overhead—no more constant copying, pasting, or cross-referencing between sheets. By using built-in macros and structured workflows, it helps maintain consistency across the analysis and ensures that factors, groupings, and categories are properly recorded and referenced.",
        "During my own work with qualitative datasets, I found that managing themes and tracking related metadata could quickly become overwhelming. This project gave me a more practical and repeatable approach, making it easier to focus on insights rather than formatting or troubleshooting formulas.",
        "The final output can be exported to a web-based format, allowing thematic findings to be reviewed and navigated more clearly. Glossaries, group relationships, and even basic risk assessment visuals are automatically included, making the end result both informative and accessible.",
        "Like my other tools, this project was also an opportunity to apply what I’ve been learning in areas like Excel automation, Python scripting, and front-end web development. It’s flexible enough to adapt to different types of thematic work—whether for research, education, or internal reporting."
