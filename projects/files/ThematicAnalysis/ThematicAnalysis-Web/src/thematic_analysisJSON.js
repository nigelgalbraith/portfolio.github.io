NSW Health is implementing a major combined\nclinical and corporate and ICT reform program to address these issues.\nImplementation of IT solutions to support staff and embed business\nprocesses is critical to ensuring change to delivery of services is\nsustainable. To be successful this requires a change in the way that ICT\nsolutions are procured, designed and implemented.\nHistoric investment decisions and decision-making have resulted in Area\nHealth Services developing disparate clinical and corporate applications,\nsupporting mixed infrastructure and integration approaches. This has\nresulted in:\n• Very high integration cost and difficulty gaining a comprehensive\nclinical or management information;\n• Duplication of effort and little reuse of technology assets;\n• Existence of information gaps and overlaps;\n• Different clinical specialty systems making it difficult to effectively\nmanage the patient journey and give clinicians a single view of their\npatients;\n• Twenty-nine systems support basic HR functions;\n• Systems that are more than 20 years old and have limited support.",
