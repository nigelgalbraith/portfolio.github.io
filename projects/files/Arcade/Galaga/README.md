# Galaga in JS


## Description
This project is a recreation of the classic arcade game Galaga, implemented in JavaScript. I was inspired to recreate this game to learn more about game development and to bring a piece of nostalgia to the web. The game has been constructed from the ground up, using its own game engine in developed in JavaScript. This approach was adopted to gain a deeper understanding of some of the fundamental systems in game development. The game is very similar to the original and uses some of the same visual sprites, but is not an exact copy. 

You can play the game [here](https://jwilliams219.github.io/galaga/). It works on PC/Mobile Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML5 Canvas

## Development
To run the game locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Game Instructions
On a keyboard, use the arrow keys to move your spaceship left and right, and the spacebar to shoot at the enemy spaceships. On mobile, there a slider to move your spaceship left and right, and a button to shoot at the enemy spaceships. The game ends when the player's spaceship is hit three times.
